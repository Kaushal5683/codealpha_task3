# Codealpha Task 3

This project is part of a coding challenge or task where we have a `client` and a `server` component. The `client` is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the `server` is implemented using Node.js. The server handles the business logic, and the client provides a user interface for interacting with the server.

## Project Structure
- `client/`: Contains the front-end code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- `server/`: Contains the back-end code (Node.js or other server-side logic).

## Features
- Client-side interaction with server.
- Server-side logic for handling requests.
- [Add any additional features or specific functionality here]

## Installation

### Client

2. Start the server:
